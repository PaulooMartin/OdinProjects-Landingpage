# Odin-LandingPage
Hello guys! This is my repository for the [Landing Page project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

## Description
Overall, the experience of creating the website using HTML and CSS was fun. I incorporated a few things that happened in my life recently. One of those things was moving to another place, as you can see from the boat parts images I had. Currently, I am here in A$H8AY (Ashbay). It's called Ashbay because the shores nearby are forming some sort of sea-floor and coral stuff, and the material, when dug, is made of sand that is quite blackish in color. I don't have an idea as to what it is; it looks like ash, so we call it Ashbay.
